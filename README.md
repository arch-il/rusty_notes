# ! DISCONTINUED !
This project has been discontinued. I only started working on it, because I couldn't find anything for my personal needs, but after some compormise and a lot of customization I made Obsidian work. If anyone wants to continue working on it, feel free to take everyting. If anyone wants me to finish this up, or has any questions, reach me at discord: arch_il.
# Rusty Notes
my take on minimalist journal app made with ratatui. Aim is to create simple note taking app that motivates user to make daily entries and keep a streak.
